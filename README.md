# hello-world

Hello,

This is me learing how to commit (same as saving), commit messages (same as comments that explain why a change was made), and brances (different versions of the same file).

I am now attempting to learn how to use GITHUB and Kraken together.

I just tried to push something through, but it still seems like I have a branch. Still have to learn about that. 
<<<<<<< HEAD

Pull requests are requests done a user that asks to the master branch, hey, I made some changes, can you review them and tell me if they are okay to merge with the master branch.

>>>>>>> edits2

Okay, so look here I can edit my files online.

Now I have seen my updates online, and can send it back to the remote (Github)
