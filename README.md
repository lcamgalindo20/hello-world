# hello-world

Hello,

This is me learing how to commit (same as saving), commit messages (same as comments that explain why a change was made), and brances (different versions of the same file).

I am now attempting to learn how to use GITHUB and Kraken together.

I just tried to push something through, but it still seems like I have a branch. Still have to learn about that.
